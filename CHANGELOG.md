# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

---

## [2.3.3] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **`OUTPUT_LANG` validation:** unsupported values (e.g. `fr`, `es`) now print a
  warning to stderr and fall back to the default behaviour (same language as input),
  instead of being silently ignored.
- **`.env.example` clarified:** `OUTPUT_LANG` documentation now explicitly explains
  the three cases (empty/unset, `en`, unsupported) to avoid confusion.

---

## [2.3.2] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **Microphone pre-check always failed:** `rec` cannot write to `/dev/null`
  (it infers format from the file extension); replaced with a temp `.wav` file.
- **Audio reset now uses PipeWire:** replaced `pactl suspend-source/sink`
  (requires `pulseaudio-utils`) with `systemctl --user restart pipewire
  pipewire-pulse`, which works on modern Linux without extra packages.

---

## [2.3.1] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **`.directory` added to `.gitignore`:** KDE/Dolphin auto-generated file was
  tracked by git, causing `vox-refiner-update.sh --apply` to fail with
  "Local tracked changes detected" on installations where the file manager
  had modified or deleted it.

---

## [2.3.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added

- **`OUTPUT_LANG=en`:** force English output regardless of spoken input language.
  Useful for developers working in English-only tools (VS Code, Claude Code) while
  speaking French or another language. Technical terms stay in English naturally.
  Set in `.env`; unset or empty preserves the default behaviour (reply in the same
  language as the input).

---

## [2.2.1] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- **Microphone not activating via keyboard shortcut:** removed `setsid` from `rec`
  so PulseAudio/PipeWire grants microphone access when launched from a `.desktop`
  shortcut (session isolation was preventing device access).
- **Pre-check microphone access:** added a 0.1 s probe before recording; if the
  device is locked, VoxRefiner automatically resets PulseAudio sources/sinks and
  retries, with a clear error message if recovery fails.
- **Orphan `rec` cleanup:** previous interrupted runs can leave a zombie `rec`
  process holding the device; VoxRefiner now kills orphan `rec.*local_audio`
  processes at startup (pattern is specific to VoxRefiner — visio/webcam apps are
  never affected).

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-03-20

### Changed — Mistral model routing (deprecation adaptation)

- **SHORT tier:** `devstral-small-latest` → `mistral-small-latest` (primary),
  `mistral-small-latest` → `mistral-medium-latest` (fallback).
  `devstral-small-latest` is deprecated (end of life: 2026-03-31);
  `mistral-small-latest` v4 is a MoE that integrates devstral-small and covers
  both technical and conversational short texts.
- **HISTORY extraction:** `magistral-small-latest` → `mistral-small-latest` (primary),
  `mistral-medium-latest` (fallback). Avoids rate-limit contention with the
  MEDIUM refinement tier (magistral-small).
- `mistral-medium-latest` is now the universal fallback across all tiers.

### Added

- **Model name display:** the terminal always shows which model produced the
  clipboard text — whether primary, fallback, or raw Voxtral (refinement failed).
  Previously only visible in `REFINE_COMPARE_MODELS` mode.
- **OUTPUT_PROFILE aliases:** `dev` (→ `structured`) and `accessibility`
  (→ `prose`) for more intuitive configuration.
- `SHOW_RAW_VOXTRAL` documentation added to README.

### Fixed

- `_THRESHOLD_SHORT` default corrected from `90` to `80` — the value had drifted
  during a refactor.
- History extraction now injects `context.txt` as `<user_context>` so the model
  can identify relevant facts and avoid re-extracting information already in the
  permanent context.
- `docs/model-selection.md` model tables and rationale corrected (primary/fallback
  were inverted in SHORT and MEDIUM tiers).
- `docs/resilience.md` speed factors corrected: `magistral-small-latest` × 3.0,
  `magistral-medium-latest` × 4.5.

### Other

- Logo files renamed to English convention (`subtitle`, `text`).
- LostInTab branding added to README and LICENSE.
- `.markdownlint.json` updated to allow `p`, `a`, `img` HTML elements.

### Tests

- Added `SHOW_RAW_VOXTRAL` unit and integration tests.
- Integration sandbox fake `refine.py` now writes `VOXTRAL_MODELS_FILE` to
  match real model-name display behaviour.

---

## [2.1.2] — 2026-03-16

### Added

- `SHOW_RAW_VOXTRAL` env var: shows the raw Voxtral transcription alongside
  the refined result without running a second model. Produces a 2-way view
  (`[1] Raw Voxtral` / `[2] Result`) at no extra API cost or delay.
  `REFINE_COMPARE_MODELS=true` continues to imply a 3-way view and supersedes
  this option.

---

## [2.1.1] — 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- `.env.example`: model routing was inverted for all three tiers — primary and
  fallback were swapped. Corrected to match the code defaults and the decisions
  documented in `[1.4.0]` (magistral/devstral as primary, mistral as fallback).

### Changed

- `AUDIO_TEMPO` accepted range narrowed from `[0.5, 2.0]` to `[1.0, 2.0]` in
  `record_and_transcribe_local.sh` — values below 1.0 slow down transcription
  without meaningful quality gain.
- `.env.example` `AUDIO_TEMPO` default set to `1.25` (conservative starting point
  for fast speakers or strong accents); the code default remains `1.5` when
  `AUDIO_TEMPO` is not defined in `.env`.
- `.env.example` reorganised into three tiers: **Required** / **Features**
  (`OUTPUT_PROFILE`, `ENABLE_HISTORY`, `AUDIO_TEMPO`) / **Advanced** (model
  routing, history models, modes, resilience) — with clearer comments throughout.
- `Readme.md` routing table corrected to show the actual default models.
- `Readme.md` audio tempo description updated to reflect the `1.25` / `1.5`
  distinction and added guidance for fast speakers.
- `Readme.md` new **Output formatting profiles** section documents all four
  `OUTPUT_PROFILE` values with their use cases.
- `Readme.md` compare mode description updated to mention parallel execution.
- `Readme.md` recording safeguards removed from Advanced options (implementation
  detail not relevant to end-user configuration).

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Parallel compare mode**: primary and fallback models now run simultaneously
  when `REFINE_COMPARE_MODELS=true`. Total wall-clock time is `max(primary, fallback)`
  instead of `primary + fallback`. Compare result is displayed only if primary
  succeeded; if primary fails the compare thread result is discarded.
- **Output formatting profiles** (`OUTPUT_PROFILE` env var): four named profiles
  inject a `FORMAT:` instruction into the system prompt for MEDIUM and LONG tiers.
  Short texts are always plain regardless of the setting.
  - `plain` (default) — no change, current behaviour preserved
  - `prose` — clean paragraphs, no lists; best for general use and screen readers
  - `structured` — paragraphs + bullet points for key ideas; best for developers
  - `technical` — Markdown (headers, paragraphs, bullets); best for docs / AI chat
- `OUTPUT_PROFILE` documented in `.env.example` with descriptions of each profile.

### Changed

- `_PROMPT_FOOTER` now includes a `{format_block}` placeholder rendered at
  runtime from `_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS[OUTPUT_PROFILE]`; all three prompt
  templates are updated accordingly.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- `_get_audio_duration()` now raises `RuntimeError` instead of crashing with
  `ValueError` when ffprobe returns an empty or invalid result.
- `_detect_silences()` now logs a warning and returns an empty list (hard cuts)
  when ffmpeg exits with a non-zero code, instead of silently proceeding.
- ffmpeg chunk-creation in `_split_audio()` now logs a warning when a chunk
  fails to encode.
- `_transcribe_single()` now validates the Voxtral JSON response structure and
  raises `RuntimeError` on a missing or non-string `"text"` field.
- `_call_model()` now wraps nested JSON response access in a try/except and
  raises `RuntimeError` on unexpected API response structure.
- `history.txt` write is now atomic: written to `.tmp` then renamed via
  `Path.replace()`, preventing corruption on interrupted writes.
- `2>/dev/tty` replaced by `2>&3` (saved stderr FD) in all Python subprocess
  calls in the shell script — avoids failure when no controlling terminal is
  available (e.g. test sandboxes, systemd units).
- Two integration tests (`test_recording_mode_cleans_and_rebuilds_audio_artifacts`,
  `test_retry_mode_skips_recording_and_processing`) that were failing due to the
  `/dev/tty` issue are now passing.

### Added

- `CLAUDE.md`: AI collaboration guide covering architecture, technical decisions,
  commit rules, and deployment instructions.
- `record_and_transcribe_local.sh`: cleanup trap (`trap _cleanup EXIT`) removes
  temp files on any exit, preventing orphaned files in `/tmp`.
- `record_and_transcribe_local.sh`: `AUDIO_TEMPO` is now validated at startup
  (must be in `[0.5, 2.0]`); an informative error is shown if out of range.
- `record_and_transcribe_local.sh`: xclip result is now checked; a warning is
  shown if clipboard copy fails instead of silently reporting success.

### Changed

- `_SECURITY_BLOCK` and `_PROMPT_FOOTER` extracted as shared constants in
  `refine.py`; the 3 system prompt templates are now built by concatenation,
  eliminating duplicated security and footer blocks.
- `requirements.txt`: dependencies pinned to exact versions for reproducibility
  (`requests==2.32.5`, `python-dotenv==1.2.2`).

---

## [1.9.3] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- History updates no longer wipe existing entries when the model returns only
  newly extracted bullets; existing bullets are preserved automatically.
- History rotation now drops the oldest bullets first by keeping the most
  recent entries when the file exceeds the configured limit.

### Changed

- `HISTORY_MAX_BULLETS` default increased to `100`.
- History extraction now sends only the most recent 80% of existing bullets to
  the model, reserving 20% capacity for new entries on each update.

---

## [1.9.2] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- History extraction fallback now handles network/request exceptions (including
  read timeouts) and switches to the fallback model instead of aborting early.

### Changed

- Added a history-only timeout multiplier (`HISTORY_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER`, default
  `1.5`) to increase timeout headroom for non-blocking background history updates.
- Documented `HISTORY_TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER` in `.env.example` and README.

---

## [1.9.1] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- `vox-refiner-update.sh --apply` now auto-normalizes local deletions for files
  already removed upstream (legacy rename cleanup), instead of failing with
  "Local tracked changes detected"
- Updater post-update permission repair is now resilient when optional runtime
  files are absent in minimal clones/tests

### Added

- Integration coverage for updater behavior when a tracked file is deleted both
  locally and upstream before `--apply`

### Changed

- README update section now documents that obsolete local deletions are handled
  automatically during `--apply`

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- `install.sh` one-shot installer:
  - checks required system tools (`python3`, `python3-venv`, `ffmpeg`, `sox`, `xclip`)
  - creates `.venv` and installs Python dependencies
  - creates missing local files from templates (`.env`, `context.txt`, launcher)
  - applies executable permissions (`chmod +x`) on runtime scripts

### Changed

- `record_and_transcribe_local.sh` now uses `./.venv/bin/python` explicitly
  (no manual `source .venv/bin/activate` required for keyboard/desktop launches)
- README installation flow simplified around `./install.sh`
- README requirements clarified: `ffmpeg`, `sox`, and `xclip` are system dependencies
- Renamed desktop entry template file to follow the `*.example.*` convention:
  `vox-refiner.desktop.example` → `vox-refiner.example.desktop`
- Updated `Readme.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` references to the new template name
- Removed accidental tracked personal launcher `launch_vox-refiner.sh` from the repository
- Added backward-compatible ignore rule for legacy personal launcher name
  (`launch_vox-refiner.sh`) in `.gitignore`
- Clarified in README why `launch-vox-refiner.example.sh` is kept: shared template
  vs local personal launcher copy
- `launch-vox-refiner.example.sh` now auto-detects a terminal emulator with fallback order:
  `mate-terminal` -> `gnome-terminal` -> `xfce4-terminal` -> `konsole` -> `xterm`
- Added optional `VOXREFINER_TERMINAL` override in launcher template
- README updated to document terminal fallback and override
- `install.sh` now installs `xterm` when using `--install-system-deps` and warns
  when no supported terminal emulator is detected

---

## [1.8.8] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- `vox-refiner.desktop.example` template to simplify desktop menu launcher setup

### Changed

- README keyboard shortcut section formatting fixed and expanded with
  `.desktop` setup steps and validation commands

---

## [1.8.7] — 2026-03-14

### Changed

- Launcher naming harmonized to kebab-case:
  - `launch_vox-refiner.sh` → `launch-vox-refiner.sh`
  - `launch_vox-refiner.example.sh` → `launch-vox-refiner.example.sh`
- Updated launcher references in docs and scripts (`Readme.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `.gitignore`, `vox-refiner-update.sh`)
- Harmonized `launch-vox-refiner.sh` content with the launcher template style
  and naming conventions
- Fixed README keyboard-shortcut section formatting and command block rendering

---

## [1.8.6] — 2026-03-14

### Changed

- Scripts renamed for naming consistency with the `vox-refiner` repo slug:
  - `launch_voxtral.sh` → `launch_vox-refiner.sh`
  - `launch_voxtral.example.sh` → `launch_vox-refiner.example.sh`
  - `voxrefiner-update.sh` → `vox-refiner-update.sh`
- PID temp file renamed `/tmp/voxtral_terminal.pid` → `/tmp/vox-refiner_terminal.pid`
- All references updated in `Readme.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `record_and_transcribe_local.sh`,
  `vox-refiner-update.sh` (self-reference), and tests

---

## [1.8.5] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- `vox-refiner-update.sh` with:
  - `--check`: fetch remote refs/tags and report update status
  - `--apply`: fast-forward-only update flow with tracked-tree safety checks
- `context.example.txt` template for personal domain vocabulary/context

### Changed

- `context.txt` is now ignored by git and intended as a local file created from
  `context.example.txt`
- End-of-run quick commands now include update commands:
  - `./vox-refiner-update.sh --check`
  - `./vox-refiner-update.sh --apply`
- README installation/update flow now documents the new context and update
  workflow

---

## [1.8.4] — 2026-03-14

### Changed

- `silenceremove` filter: switched to `detection=peak` (faster than default `rms`)
  and added `start_periods=1` to also strip leading silence before the first word

---

## [1.8.3] — 2026-03-14

### Added

- New logo asset set under `Logo/`:
  - `Logo/VoxRefiner_Logo.svg`
  - `Logo/VoxRefiner_subtitile_Logo.svg`
  - `Logo/VoxRefiner_old.svg` (archived previous variant)
- New test coverage for recording script safeguards:
  - `tests/integration/test_record_and_transcribe_script.py`: executes the shell
    script in a sandbox with stubbed `rec`/`ffmpeg`/`xclip`; covers clean-start,
    WAV size rejection, and retry mode
  - `tests/unit/test_record_script_structure.py`: asserts key safety primitives
    are present in the script

### Changed

- README logo reference now uses `Logo/VoxRefiner_subtitile_Logo.svg` and updated
  hero sizing/tagline copy.
- Recording pipeline hardening in `record_and_transcribe_local.sh`:
  - clean audio artifacts (`local_audio.wav`, `local_audio.mp3`) before new recording
  - record to temporary WAV and promote only after validation
  - reject abnormally large WAV files via configurable `MAX_WAV_BYTES`
- `docs/resilience.md`: new _Recording-stage safeguards_ section documenting the
  three shell-level guards

### Fixed

- `tests/unit/test_refine_timing.py`: aligned timeout factor expectations with
  current `_MODEL_SPEED_FACTOR` values (`magistral-medium-latest` ×4.5,
  `magistral-small-latest` ×3.0)

### Removed

- Legacy root logo file `VoxRefiner.svg` removed (replaced by assets in `Logo/`).

---

## [1.8.2] — 2026-03-13

### Changed

- **Project rebrand**: renamed public project name from **Voxtral Paste** to
  **VoxRefiner** to avoid trademark confusion with third-party commercial names
- **Repository and install paths**: updated documentation/examples from
  `voxtral-paste` to `vox-refiner`
- **README branding refresh**: updated title/text references to VoxRefiner and
  added project logo (`VoxRefiner.svg`)
- **README messaging refresh**: updated the product tagline and intro copy to the
  new VoxRefiner branding narrative
- **Supporting docs/examples/tests**: aligned naming references across
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/*`, `history.example.txt`, launcher examples, and
  prompt-related test fixtures

### Fixed

- **README markdown lint compatibility**: adjusted logo rendering with scoped
  markdownlint directives while preserving centered display on GitHub

---

## [1.8.1] — 2026-03-11

### Changed

- **Model speed factors recalibrated**: `magistral-small-latest` ×2.5 → ×3.0,
  `magistral-medium-latest` ×3.0 → ×4.5 — observed timeouts on long transcriptions
  (≥ 240 words) confirmed the previous factors were too low for reasoning models
- **System prompts hardened** (SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG):
  - New `SECURITY` block: explicitly identifies the `<transcription>` content as
    untrusted external input and guards against prompt-injection patterns
    ("ignore previous instructions", "you are now…", "pretend that…")
  - `IMPORTANT` block: extended to cover questions addressed to an AI assistant;
    added "The speaker is talking to someone else" clarification to prevent the model
    from treating spoken questions as requests directed at itself
  - Point 1 (SHORT) and Point 3 (MEDIUM/LONG): sources for vocabulary correction now
    explicitly include `<history>` in addition to `<context>`; guard added to forbid
    injecting any name, concept, or technical detail absent from those sources;
    `<history>` inaccuracy warning added
  - Point 5 (MEDIUM/LONG): reinforced with explicit prohibition on completing reasoning
    chains, answering spoken questions, or adding unstated examples/conclusions;
    open-ended output must remain open-ended
  - LONG Point 4: "voice" removed from "speaker's words, voice, and register" —
    the model receives text only, not audio

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Voxtral-only mode** (`ENABLE_REFINE=false`): skip AI refinement entirely — the raw
  Voxtral transcription is copied to clipboard as-is, with no Mistral chat call
- **Side-by-side comparison** (`REFINE_COMPARE_MODELS=true`): after the primary model
  succeeds, the fallback also runs; 3-way display in the terminal (raw Voxtral → primary
  with model name → fallback with model name); primary copied to clipboard immediately,
  behaviour unchanged
- **Retry without re-recording** (`--retry` / `-r` flag): reuses the existing
  `local_audio.mp3` and skips microphone capture and audio processing — useful when
  Voxtral transcription failed or refinement produced an unexpected result
- Both new env vars (`ENABLE_REFINE`, `REFINE_COMPARE_MODELS`) added to `.env.example`
  and `.env`

### Fixed

- Startup error: `cd` and `SCRIPT_NAME=` were concatenated on the same line, causing
  `cd` to fail with a path-not-found error; newline restored
- History update was evaluated against refined-text word count instead of raw Voxtral
  word count — AI models often compress text significantly, incorrectly suppressing
  history updates for MEDIUM/LONG recordings; now uses `raw_transcription` word count
  (consistent with Python model routing)
- Fallback compare result was printed to the terminal _during_ Python execution (before
  the primary was displayed); reordered via temp file so display is always raw → primary
  → fallback

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Per-model speed factors** (`_MODEL_SPEED_FACTOR`): Magistral models (chain-of-thought
  reasoning) receive a 2.5–3× timeout multiplier; `_effective_timeout(base, model)` applies
  the factor at call time
- `docs/resilience.md`: new "Per-model speed factors" and "History extraction timeout" sections

### Changed

- **Audio pipeline**: replaced separate `sox` + `ffmpeg` + `lame` commands (3 tools, 2 temp
  files) with a single `ffmpeg` command — silence removal, tempo shift and MP3 encoding in one
  pass; `sox` and `lame` are no longer required
- **Timeout bases reduced (Option A)** to compensate for the multipliers: range is now 3–80 s
  (was 3–180 s); column renamed "Base timeout" in `docs/resilience.md`
- Default model routing updated in `.env.example`:
  - SHORT: `mistral-small-latest` / `devstral-small-latest`
  - MEDIUM: `mistral-medium-latest` / `magistral-small-latest`
  - LONG: `mistral-medium-latest` / `magistral-medium-latest`
  - HISTORY: `magistral-small-latest` / `mistral-medium-latest`

---

## [1.6.2] — 2026-03-11

### Added

- `background` parameter to `_refine_timing()`: passing `background=True` doubles the
  base timeout — history extraction is a fire-and-forget task that should not constrain
  foreground timeouts

### Fixed

- `_extract_and_update_history()` was using the same foreground timeout as `refine()`;
  it now calls `_refine_timing(wc, background=True)` to get a doubled base timeout,
  preventing spurious timeouts on background history updates

---

## [1.6.1] — 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- `requests.Timeout` (ReadTimeout) was not caught inside `_transcribe_single()`, so it
  escaped the retry loop and propagated as an unhandled exception; it is now caught and
  retried like other transient errors
- First-tier Voxtral timeout raised from 2 s to 3 s — a 177 KB file reliably triggered
  a ReadTimeoutError at 2 s under normal load

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Adaptive timeouts for Voxtral** (`_get_timeout`): 8 file-size tiers from 3 s (< 300 KB)
  to 55 s (< 19.5 MB / ~60 min)
- **Adaptive timeouts for Refine** (`_refine_timing`): 10 word-count tiers
- **Retry loop** for transient HTTP errors (429 / 500 / 502 / 503) in both
  `_transcribe_single()` and `refine()` / `_extract_and_update_history()`
- **Audio splitting** for recordings ≥ 19.5 MB (~60 min): `_split_audio()` detects
  silence boundaries and cuts at ~30 min intervals; each chunk is transcribed independently
- `TRANSCRIBE_REQUEST_RETRIES` and `REFINE_REQUEST_RETRIES` env vars (default: 2 extra
  attempts, i.e. 3 total)
- `docs/resilience.md`: full documentation of timeout / retry / splitting logic

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-08

### Added

- `history.txt`: optional auto-generated context file built from MEDIUM/LONG refinements
  - Enable with `ENABLE_HISTORY=true` in `.env` (opt-in, off by default)
  - Extracts contextual facts (projects, tools, decisions, topics) from refined text
  - Injected into the system prompt for all tiers to improve refinement relevance
  - Configurable: `HISTORY_MAX_BULLETS` (default 60), `HISTORY_EXTRACTION_MODEL` (default `magistral-small-latest`)
  - **Clipboard-first architecture:** extraction runs in the background via `--update-history` CLI flag,
    launched by the shell script **after** the clipboard is populated — never delays the paste operation
  - Added `history.txt` to `.gitignore` (personal file, stays local)
  - Added `history.example.txt` to document the expected format

### Changed

- Default SHORT threshold reduced to **90 words** (was 100) — 100 was too permissive; notes of 90–99 words were routed to MEDIUM unnecessarily
- All 3 system prompts now include an explicit **anti-prompt-injection guard**: the model is instructed to treat `<transcription>` content as raw voice data, never as directives (fixes cases where the AI followed apparent instructions contained in a long transcription)
- Updated `.env.example` and Readme routing table (90 / 240)

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-06

### Added

- `docs/model-selection.md`: rationale and test observations for model and threshold choices per tier (SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG)
- Model comparison testing via OpenWebUI documented for all 3 tiers

### Changed

- Default routing thresholds updated: SHORT < 100 words (was 80), LONG ≥ 240 words (was 200)
- Updated `.env.example` and Readme routing table to reflect new thresholds (100 / 240)

### Decision

- All primary models confirmed after OpenWebUI testing: `devstral-small-latest` (SHORT), `magistral-small-latest` (MEDIUM), `magistral-medium-latest` (LONG)

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- API error body (first 200 chars) now logged to stderr on 429 / 500 / 503, replacing the generic "unavailable, switching..." message — makes rate limiting and server errors easier to diagnose

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-06

### Added

- 3 distinct system prompt templates by tier (SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG)
- XML tags: `<transcription>` wraps user input in the user message; `<context>` wraps domain context in the system prompt
- Prose quality instruction for LONG tier (> 200 words): "well-structured written prose — fluid and precise, while staying true to the speaker's voice and register"
- Deployment section in CONTRIBUTING.md (rsync usage, chmod warning)
- Updating section in README

### Fixed

- Language rule strengthened: `CRITICAL: Never translate. Detect the language of the transcription and reply in that exact same language.`
- Context block moved to end of each prompt (after all instructions) to avoid the "Lost in the Middle" attention drop

### Changed

- Installation guide in README: `git clone` directly to `~/.local/bin/vox-refiner/`, explicit `chmod +x` step
- `.markdownlint.json` added to suppress MD013 / MD024 false positives in CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTING

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-06

### Added

- 3-tier model routing based on transcription length:
  - < 80 words → `devstral-small-latest` (fast)
  - 80–200 words → `magistral-small-latest` (balanced)
  - > 200 words → `magistral-medium-latest` (deep reasoning)
- Configurable thresholds and models via `.env` (`REFINE_MODEL_THRESHOLD_SHORT`, `REFINE_MODEL_THRESHOLD_LONG`, etc.)
- Correct fallback message displayed in terminal when primary model is unavailable

### Fixed

- `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'strip'` — reasoning models (magistral) return `content` as a list of blocks; now handled properly
- Fallback terminal message was never displayed due to a logic bug — now shows `⚠️ primary unavailable — switching to fallback: <model>`

### Changed

- Medium tier fallback set to `mistral-medium-latest` (was `mistral-small-latest`)
- Updated `.env.example` and README routing table to reflect 3-tier structure

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-05

### Added

- MIT License (`LICENSE` file) with copyright notice
- License badge in README
- License section at the bottom of README

### Fixed

- `setsid rec` — isolates the recording process into its own session to prevent double SIGINT on Ctrl+C

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-05

### Added

- Initial release
- Full voice-to-text pipeline: record → speed up → silence removal → MP3 → Voxtral transcription → Mistral refinement → clipboard
- 2-tier model routing (short / long) with fallback chain
- `context.txt` for user domain vocabulary injection into the refinement prompt
- Graceful degradation: returns raw transcription if all models fail
- `.env` configuration with `.env.example` template
- `launch-vox-refiner.example.sh` for keyboard shortcut setup (multi-terminal documented)
- `.gitignore` excluding `.env`, `launch-vox-refiner.sh`, audio files
