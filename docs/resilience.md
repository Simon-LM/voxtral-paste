# Resilience — Timeouts, Retries & Audio Splitting

This document describes the retry and timeout strategy used by Voxtral Paste
to handle transient API errors and large audio files gracefully.

---

## Overview

Two distinct components make HTTP calls to the Mistral API:

| Component                                    | File                | Purpose                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `transcribe()`                               | `src/transcribe.py` | Audio → raw text (Voxtral)                    |
| `refine()` / `_extract_and_update_history()` | `src/refine.py`     | Raw text → refined text (Mistral / Magistral) |

Each has its own adaptive timeout logic and shares the same retry mechanic.

---

## Retry behaviour (both components)

Retries are triggered **only on transient HTTP errors**: 429 (rate limit),
500, 502, 503 (server errors).

- **Timeout** and **ConnectionError** are NOT retried — there is no point waiting
  again if the server did not respond at all. The fallback model is tried immediately.
- **401 / 403** (authentication) and **404** are never retried.
- On 429, the stderr message explicitly says "rate limit" to distinguish it from
  server errors.

Number of extra attempts is configurable (default: 2, i.e. 3 total attempts):

```dotenv
TRANSCRIBE_REQUEST_RETRIES=2   # for Voxtral
REFINE_REQUEST_RETRIES=2       # for Mistral / Magistral
```

Set to `0` to disable retries entirely.

## Voxtral — adaptive timeout by file size

The audio file sent to Voxtral is MP3 @64 kbps, with speech accelerated ×1.5
and long silences removed. File size is therefore a reliable proxy for audio duration.

The timeout is computed in `_get_timeout(file_size)`:

| File size | ≈ speech duration    | Timeout             |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| < 300 KB  | ≈ 80 words / ~37 s   | 3 s                 |
| < 800 KB  | ≈ 240 words / ~110 s | 3 s                 |
| < 1.5 MB  | ≈ 500 words / ~4 min | 5 s                 |
| < 4 MB    | ≈ 10 min             | 12 s                |
| < 8 MB    | ≈ 20 min             | 20 s                |
| < 12 MB   | ≈ 30 min             | 30 s                |
| < 14.5 MB | ≈ 45 min             | 42 s                |
| < 19.5 MB | ≈ 60 min             | 55 s                |
| ≥ 19.5 MB | > 60 min             | → split (see below) |

The retry delay for Voxtral is fixed at **2 s** (the task is near-instantaneous
when the API is healthy; a short pause is enough to absorb a transient spike).

---

## Voxtral — audio splitting for files > 60 min

Files ≥ 19.5 MB (~60 min of speech after processing) exceed what can reasonably
be sent in a single API call. They are automatically split before transcription.

### How splitting works (`_split_audio`)

1. **Detect silences** — `ffmpeg silencedetect` scans the file for pauses ≥ 0.5 s
   at −35 dB.
2. **Choose cut points** — every ~30 minutes, the nearest silence within ±2 minutes
   of the boundary is used as the actual cut point. If no silence is found nearby,
   a hard cut is made at exactly 30 min.
3. **Extract chunks** — `ffmpeg -c copy` extracts each segment without re-encoding.
4. **Transcribe sequentially** — each chunk is sent to Voxtral independently,
   with its own adaptive timeout based on its size.
5. **Concatenate** — results are joined with a space; temporary chunk files are
   deleted immediately after use.

This avoids cutting in the middle of a sentence in the vast majority of cases.

## Refine — adaptive timeout by word count

After transcription, the raw text is refined by a Mistral or Magistral model.
The base timeout (and retry delay) scale with the word count of the text,
computed by `_refine_timing(word_count)`:

| Word count    | Base timeout | Retry delay |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| < 30          | 3 s          | 1 s         |
| 30 – 89       | 4 s          | 1 s         |
| 90 – 179      | 6 s          | 1.5 s       |
| 180 – 239     | 8 s          | 2 s         |
| 240 – 399     | 11 s         | 2 s         |
| 400 – 599     | 15 s         | 2 s         |
| 600 – 999     | 20 s         | 3 s         |
| 1 000 – 1 999 | 30 s         | 4 s         |
| 2 000 – 3 999 | 50 s         | 5 s         |
| ≥ 4 000       | 80 s         | 8 s         |

These are **base timeouts**. The effective timeout applied at runtime is
`_effective_timeout(base, model)`, which multiplies the base by a per-model
speed factor (see below).

---

## Per-model speed factors

Magistral models produce chain-of-thought reasoning before their final answer,
making them intrinsically 2.5–3× slower than plain completion models.
A per-model factor is applied to prevent premature timeouts:

| Model                     | Factor | Notes                       |
| ------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `devstral-small-latest`   | × 1.0  |                             |
| `mistral-small-latest`    | × 1.0  |                             |
| `mistral-medium-latest`   | × 1.2  | Slightly heavier than small |
| `magistral-small-latest`  | × 2.5  | Chain-of-thought reasoning  |
| `magistral-medium-latest` | × 3.0  | Chain-of-thought reasoning  |
| `mistral-large-latest`    | × 1.5  |                             |

Unknown models default to × 1.0.

**Example:** 202 words → base = 8 s. With `magistral-medium-latest` (× 3.0)
the effective timeout is **24 s**.

## History extraction timeout

The same `_refine_timing()` function is used for history extraction calls,
using the word count of the refined text. Because the call is made
**in the background** (the clipboard is already populated at that point),
the base timeout is **doubled** via `_refine_timing(wc, background=True)` —
giving history extraction extra slack without ever delaying the paste operation.
The per-model speed factor is applied on top of the doubled base.

---

## Fallback model chain

Both `refine()` and `_extract_and_update_history()` have a two-model fallback:

```text
primary model  →  (retry up to N times on 429/5xx)
                       ↓ if all attempts fail
fallback model →  (retry up to N times on 429/5xx)
                       ↓ if all attempts fail
refine()             : returns raw transcription unchanged (graceful degradation)
_extract_and_update_history() : raises RuntimeError (caller logs and continues)
```

401 / 403 errors skip the fallback and raise immediately — retrying with a
different model will not fix an authentication problem.
