"""Step 2: Raw transcription → refined text via Mistral chat API.

Model routing (3 tiers):
  - Short  (< REFINE_MODEL_THRESHOLD_SHORT words) → devstral-small-latest
  - Medium (≥ REFINE_MODEL_THRESHOLD_SHORT words) → magistral-small-latest
  - Long   (≥ REFINE_MODEL_THRESHOLD_LONG  words) → magistral-medium-latest

Default thresholds: SHORT = 90, LONG = 240.

Each tier has a fallback model. If all models are exhausted, the raw
transcription is returned unchanged (graceful degradation).

History extraction (optional, ENABLE_HISTORY=true):
  Invoked via --update-history CLI flag, runs in the background from the shell
  script AFTER the clipboard is populated — never delays the paste operation.

Your task:
1. Correct transcription errors using the information in <context> and <history>. \
You may use names, technical terms, and project details found in <context> or <history> \

3. Keep the original wording as close as possible — do not rephrase or restructure \
beyond what is needed to fix transcription errors.
4. If the very first words appear abrupt or grammatically incomplete (likely microphone \
latency cutoff), reconstruct the beginning minimally and conservatively — only when \
