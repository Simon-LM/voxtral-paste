"""Step 2: Raw transcription → refined text via Mistral chat API.

Model routing (3 tiers):
  - Short  (< REFINE_MODEL_THRESHOLD_SHORT words) → mistral-small-latest
  - Medium (≥ REFINE_MODEL_THRESHOLD_SHORT words) → magistral-small-latest
  - Long   (≥ REFINE_MODEL_THRESHOLD_LONG  words) → magistral-medium-latest

Default thresholds: SHORT = 80, LONG = 240.

Each tier has a fallback model. If all models are exhausted, the raw
transcription is returned unchanged (graceful degradation).

History extraction (optional, ENABLE_HISTORY=true):
  Invoked via --update-history CLI flag, runs in the background from the shell
  script AFTER the clipboard is populated — never delays the paste operation.

You maintain a personal context history for a voice-to-text tool.
The history captures facts about the user's work: ongoing projects, tools, decisions, topics discussed.

IMPORTANT: entries are INDEPENDENT — the user may work on several unrelated projects in parallel.
Do not assume facts from different entries are related to each other.

A permanent user context is provided in <user_context> tags. Use it to understand the user's domain
and vocabulary — it helps you identify which facts from the voice note are genuinely relevant
and worth keeping in history. Do not extract facts already fully covered by <user_context>.

Your task:
1. Read the existing history in <history> tags (may be empty on first use).
   Existing bullets already carry a [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] date and time prefix — preserve them exactly as-is.
2. Extract contextual facts from the new voice note in <text> tags that add value beyond <user_context>.
3. Merge new facts with existing history: avoid duplicates, update outdated facts, keep the most relevant.
4. Return ONLY the updated bullet list, one fact per line, starting with "- ".
   Do NOT add date prefixes to new bullets — the application adds them automatically.
5. Maximum {max_bullets} bullets total. Be concise. Each bullet is one clear fact.
